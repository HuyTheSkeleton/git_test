    <h1>Iris</h1>
    <p><strong>Iris</strong> (Japanese: <strong>アイリス</strong> <em>Iris</em>) is a Dragon-type Trainer.</p>
    <p>She was one of the Gym Leaders of Opelucid City's Gym, known officially as the Opelucid Gym, giving out the Legend Badge, in Pokémon White.</p>
    <p>Two years later, in Pokémon Black 2 and White 2, she is the Champion of the Unova region's Pokémon League.</p>
    <h2>In the cores series games</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Iris appears in Pokémon Black and White. In both versions, she shows up in Castelia City to aid the player, Burgh, and Bianca when Bianca's Munna is stolen. During this time, she acts as Bianca's bodyguard.</li>

        <li>In White, she is also revealed to be the Gym Leader of Opelucid City's Gym, which is the eighth to be challenged by the player. Trainers who defeat Iris will receive the Legend Badge, along with TM82 (Dragon Tail). She reappears at N's Castle where she and the other Unova Gym Leaders hold off the Seven Sages. During summer, she also visits Cynthia at Caitlin's villa in Undella Town, as do the other female Gym Leaders.</li>

        <li>In Black, after defeating the Pokémon League, she will teach Draco Meteor to the player's Dragon-type Pokémon if they have full friendship. She can be found on the first floor of Drayden's home in Opelucid City.</li>

        <li>In Black 2 and White 2, Iris first appears in Castelia City, helping the player look for Team Plasma. She later reappears in Opelucid City but leaves shortly after meeting the player. Iris's primary role in these games is finally revealed to be that of the new Champion, replacing Alder. After training extensively under Drayden, she battled and defeated Alder after he retired as Champion, gaining the title for herself. As a gift for her victory, Drayden gave her new clothes to replace the ones he had given her after bringing her to Unova.</li>
